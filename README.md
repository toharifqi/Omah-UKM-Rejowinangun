# UKMQ

When I was doing an internship at one of tech startup in Malang, I got a lot of new things in **android development**. I learned about best practice in developing android project including best libraries that often used by company and efficient way to code #java or #kotlin (now we used to call it as SOLID principle).

So after finished the internship I challenged myself to do some more **android projects**. This project is my first project in holiday after I finished my internship. The app from this project is called UKMQ. I got this project from one of letcture from Economics and Business Faculty in my campus. This project is intended to be his devotion program in Rejowinangun village in Blitar city.

UKMQ is basically e-commerce app that allows it's users to do transaction within the app. But it was exclusively developed for the resident of Rejowinangun to improve prosperity of the UMKMs there. But what makes this app different with any other e-commerce app? This app is basically developed purely for the resident of Rejowinangun so this app is super easy to be operated (including the transaction and posting new products). And beside that, this app is free from advertisement XD.

I developed this app using #java. I also implemented some useful library like facebook shimmer (link: https://lnkd.in/geq8YAN) and zoominimageview (link: https://lnkd.in/ggZz_k7). For the back-end, I used google #firebase to provide realtime database, cloud storage, and user authentication. For the transaction, this app is still using conventional payment gateway.

Since the devotion program has completed, this app is open to public now.
